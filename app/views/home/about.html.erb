<h2 class="title">About CharterTracker</h2><br />

<div>
	<span class="bold-me">Background</span>
	<p>
		CharterTracker was originally intended to track user ratings for charter fishing trips in the NYC/Long Island region. This is only a beta version with the potential for tons of future implementations.
	</p><br />

	<span class="bold-me">Why Use CharterTracker?</span>
	<p>
		CharterTracker was designed with a few principles in mind.
	</p><br />

	<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="bold-me">• A personal fishing log</span>. You can draw your own conclusions based on captains, vessels, ports of departure, and any other comments you wish to include.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="bold-me">• CharterTracker will not blow up your spot.</span>
			CharterTracker will not track your exact fishing spot nor your coordinates so captains and users do not have to worry about their spots being put on blast.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="bold-me">• More info, less drama.</span> CharterTracker allows you to view the fishing communities data without you having to directly interact with the community.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="bold-me">• Scalability.</span>CharterTracker was designed to allow future updates and constantly adapt with the needs of the fishing community. Future implementations can include weather conditions, tide charts, as well as very appealing secret functionality that I am working on. The site is designed to capture more data while keeping your logs private so you can decide whether to share your insights.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="bold-me">• Image Storage.</span> It's all about the pictures these days. Users can store a limited number of images for free. I will try to increase this limit as the site grows and if/when I get a job.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="bold-me">• Free.</span> I'm unemployed and built this site for my friends and family to enjoy. That's basically what fishing is all about to me.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<span class="bold-me">About Me</span>

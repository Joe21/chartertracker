#CharterTracker 

*CharterTracker* is a web app designed to help anglers find the best ports to charter fishing trips while also serving as a personal fishing log.

The Beta version is currently deployed via heroku apps and can be found at [http://chartertracker.herokuapp.com](http://chartertracker.herokuapp.com).

#Why use CharterTracker?
* A personal fishing log that allows a user to track various metrics that may be affecting their fishing game (specific captains, vessels, ports, etc). 
* CharterTracker WILL NEVER blow up your spot. The app is designed to track trips based on admin approved ports of departure/locations. It will never collect your specific coordinates and will not jeopardize the integrity of a captain's prized fishing spot.
* More info, less drama. Data gathered and visualized from the fishing community without having to deal with the fishing community.
* Scalability. Future updates will include various other innovative features and metrics such as weather conditions, tides charts, etc. to provide users with even more insight on their fishing game.
* Image Storage. Offers limited free image storage for all users.
* Free. No spam. No ads. No nonsense.
